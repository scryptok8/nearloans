# NEAR MetaBUILD III Hackathon

## Inspiration

## What it does
nearloans.finance allows NEAR users to lend and borrow NEP-141 fungible tokens through colateralized loans.

## How we built it
The platform is made up of several smart contracts and an user interface deployed at nearloans.finance.
The smart contract were developed using the typescript version of near-sdk.
The web interface was crafted from a generic ReactJS template

## Challenges we ran into
Understand the specificities of NEAR protocol, especially sharding architecture and asynchronous transactions handling in order to securely design and implement the smart contracts.  

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Implement and publish a functional loans platform during the hackathon's timeframe.

## What we learned
More knowledge around NEAR ecosystem and development process.

## What's next for Nearloans
- Audit the MVP smart contracts code and deploy it to NEAR mainnet
- Open the loan support to a wide range of NEAR fungible tokens
- Enrich loan features providing more flexibility to both borrowers and lenders and different kind of interest calculation types.
- Build a javascript sdk to interact with nearloans smart contracts
- Deploy a new NEP-141 fungible token to provide specific features and benefits for its holders on the platform
