# NEAR MetaBUILD III Hackathon

## Inspiration

## What it does
Nearloans allow NEAR users to lend and borrow NEP-141 fungible tokens through colateralized loans.

## How we built it
The platform is made up of several smart contracts and an user interface deployed at nearloans.finance.
The smart contract were developed using the typescript version of near-sdk.

## Challenges we ran into
Understand the specificities of NEAR protocol, especially sharding architecture and asynchronous transactions handling in order to securely design and implement the smart contracts.  

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Implement and publish a functional loans marketplace during the hackathon's timeframe.

## What we learned
More knowledge around NEAR ecosystem and development process.

## What's next for Nearloans
- Integrate support for popular NEP-141 fungible tokens
- Deploy a new NEP-141 fungible token ( NLT ) to provide new features and benefits on the platform for its holders.
